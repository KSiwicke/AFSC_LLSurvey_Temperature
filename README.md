# AFSC_LLSurvey_Temperature

This is intended to document the steps taken to utilize the AFSC Longline Survey temperature data. This includes use in the Sablefish ESP, Survey presentations to the Plan Teams, and Cruise Reports as well as contributions to Ecosystem Status Reports. 

Generally speaking, these indices focus on the average temperature from 1-m increments between 246-255 meters. Samples in the same localized geographic region are considered duplicates, and are used to calculate  are weighted by the geographic area for depths between 200 and 300 meters. The ESP, Plan Team, and Cruise report data is summarized at the NPFMC region, while the ESRs are delineated slightly differently. For the latter, when only one sample is available in a geographic region, a SD of 0.5 is used.
